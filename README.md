# K-domination problem
An algorithm designed to solve the k-domination problem in Operations
Research. It includes comprehensive result documentation, including results
obtained with the PULP modeler. There are two implementations of the
greedy algorithm. The genetic algorithm utilizes Tournament selection, Single
Point crossover, and mutation in each iteration to find the optimal result.
